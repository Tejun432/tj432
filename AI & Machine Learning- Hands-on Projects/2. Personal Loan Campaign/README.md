**Course:** Machine Learning

https://www.mygreatlearning.com/eportfolio/tejaswi-nalajala

## Project Objective  
Build a predictive model to identify liability customers with a high likelihood of purchasing personal loans. The goal is to support the bankâ€™s marketing team in converting depositors into loan customers through targeted campaigns, increasing interest income while retaining deposits.

## Skills & Tools Covered
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Decision Tree (Pre-pruning & Post-pruning)  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)  
- Business Recommendations  
- Customer Segmentation  

## My Learnings  
Through this Personal Loan Campaign project, I gained practical experience in applying the machine learning pipeline to a real-world business problem. I developed strong skills in data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables, handling imbalanced data, and preparing features for model input. I learned how to build, tune, and evaluate Decision Tree models, incorporating pre-pruning and post-pruning strategies to improve model generalization and performance. Using metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall, I deepened my understanding of model evaluation, especially for imbalanced classification problems. I also strengthened my skills in data visualization and interpretation by analyzing feature importance to identify key drivers of personal loan purchases. Most importantly, I learned how to turn model outputs into actionable insights and targeted marketing recommendations to support strategic decision-making in a banking context.

## Outcome  
Insights generated from this project can help AllLife Bank:
- Identify and target high-probability loan buyers based on income, education, and credit behavior  
- Optimize marketing campaigns to improve conversion rates and reduce costs  
- Expand the personal loan customer base while retaining depositors  
- Focus efforts on key customer segments to maximize campaign ROI
