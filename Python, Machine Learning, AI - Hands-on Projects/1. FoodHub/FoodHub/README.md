## Project Objective  
Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and provide actionable insights for a food aggregator company to understand the demand for different restaurants and cuisines. The goal is to enhance customer experience and improve business performance through data-driven decision-making.

## Skills & Tools Covered
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Business Recommendations  
- Bivariate Analysis  
- Univariate Analysis

## My Learnings  
Through this FoodHub Exploratory Data Analysis project, I developed strong skills in data cleaning and preparation, including handling missing values and converting data types for accurate insights. I learned how to perform univariate and bivariate analysis using visual tools like histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps to understand distributions and relationships between variables. I enhanced my proficiency in Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. The project also helped me apply business logic to real-world scenarios by calculating revenue, analyzing customer behavior, and identifying performance trends across different days and cuisine types. Most importantly, I learned how to translate data-driven observations into actionable business recommendations aimed at improving customer experience and operational efficiency.

## Outcome  
Insights generated from this project can help food aggregator companies:
- Optimize restaurant recommendations  
- Adjust marketing strategies based on cuisine popularity  
- Improve operational planning around peak demand times
